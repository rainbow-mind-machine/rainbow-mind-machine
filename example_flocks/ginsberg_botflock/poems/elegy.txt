Elegy Che Guevara

European Trib. boy's face photo'd eyes opened,
    young feminine beardless radiant kid
        lain back smiling looking upward
Calm as if ladies' lips were kissing invisible parts of the body
Aged reposeful angelic boy corpse,
    perceptive Argentine Doctor, petulant Cuba Major
        pipe mouth'd and faithfully keeping Diary
            in mosquiots Amazonas
Sleep on a hill, dull Havana Throne renounced
More sexy your neck than sad aging necks of Johnson
                            DeGaulle, Kosygin,
    or the bullet that pierced the neck of John Kennedy
Eyes more intelligent glanced up to death newspapers
    Than worried living Congress Cameras passing
        dot screens into T.V. shade, glass-eyed
        MacNamara, Dulles in old life...

Women in bowler hats sitting in mud outskirts 11,000 feet
                                    up in Heaven
            with a headache in LaPaz
        selling black potatoes brought down from earth
                                        roof'd huts
            on mountain-lipped Puno
    would've adored your desire and kissed your Visage
                            new Christ
    They'll raise up a red-bulb-eyed war-mask's
        white tusks to scare soldier-ghosts
            who shot thru your lungs

Incredible! one boy turned aside from operating room
        or healing Pampas yellow eye
    To face the stock rooms of ALCOA, Myriad Murderous
            Board Directors of United Fruit
Smog-Manufacturing Trustees of Chicago U
    Lawyer Phantoms ranged back to dead
        John Foster Dulles' Sullivan and Cromwell Lawfirm
    Acheson's mustache, Truman's bony hat
To go mad and hide in jungle on mule and point rifle at OAS
    at Rusk's egoic Courtesies, the metal deployments of
                                Pentagon
        derring-do Admen and dumbed intellectuals
            from Time to the CIA
One boy against the Stock Market all Wall Street ascream
        since Norris wrote The Pit
    afraid of free dollars showering from the Observer's
                                                Balcony
    scattered by laughing younger brothers,
Against the Tin Company, against Wire Services,
        against infra-red sensor Telepath Capitalism's
                money-crazed scientists
    against College boy millions watching Wichita Family
                                    Den T.V.

One radiant face driven mad with a rifle
        Confronting the electric networks.

Nov. 1967 — Venice, Italy
