Elegy Che Guevara

European Trib. boy's face photo'd eyes opened,
young feminine beardless radiant kid
lain back smiling looking upward
Calm as if ladies' lips were kissing invisible parts of the body
Aged reposeful angelic boy corpse,
perceptive Argentine Doctor, petulant Cuba Major
pipe mouth'd and faithfully keeping Diary
in mosquiots Amazonas
Sleep on a hill, dull Havana Throne renounced
More sexy your neck than sad aging necks of Johnson, DeGaulle, Kosygin,
or the bullet that pierced the neck of John Kennedy
Eyes more intelligent glanced up to death newspapers
Than worried living Congress Cameras passing
dot screens into T.V. shade, glass-eyed
MacNamara, Dulles in old life...

Women in bowler hats sitting in mud outskirts 11,000 feet up in Heaven
with a headache in LaPaz
selling black potatoes brought down from earth
roof'd huts on mountain-lipped Puno
would've adored your desire and kissed your Visage, new Christ
They'll raise up a red-bulb-eyed war-mask's
white tusks to scare soldier-ghosts
who shot thru your lungs

Incredible! one boy turned aside from operating room
or healing Pampas yellow eye
To face the stock rooms of ALCOA, Myriad Murderous
Board Directors of United Fruit
Smog-Manufacturing Trustees of Chicago U
Lawyer Phantoms ranged back to dead
John Foster Dulles' Sullivan and Cromwell Lawfirm
Acheson's mustache, Truman's bony hat
To go mad and hide in jungle on mule and point rifle at OAS
at Rusk's egoic Courtesies, the metal deployments of Pentagon
derring-do Admen and dumbed intellectuals
from Time to the CIA
One boy against the Stock Market all Wall Street ascream
since Norris wrote The Pit
afraid of free dollars showering from the Observer's Balcony
scattered by laughing younger brothers,
Against the Tin Company, against Wire Services,
against infra-red sensor Telepath Capitalism's
money-crazed scientists
against College boy millions watching Wichita Family Den T.V.
One radiant face driven mad with a rifle, confronting the electric networks.
Nov. 1967 â€” Venice, Italy
