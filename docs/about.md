# About Rainbow Mind Machine

**rainbow mind machine (bmm)** is a library for running Twitter bot flocks.
It is owned by the [rainbow-mind-machine](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine)
organization on Github.

Like all mind machines, **rainbow mind machine** is simple and extensible.


----


**rainbow mind machine** is an extensible framework for running Twitter bot flocks in Python.

rainbow mind machine is a **framework** because it provides components 
([Keymaker](mind-machine-docs/keymaker.md), [Shepherd](mind-machine-docs/shepherd.md),
and [Sheep](mind-machine-docs/sheep.md)) with specific roles and ways of interacting.

rainbow mind machine is **extensible** to keep bots from becoming boring. 
There are a limited number of components to extend (2), 
these two components have a simple and clear function call order,
and rainbow mind machine tries to use sensible defaults.

That means we start out with bots that "just work" 
and we can incrementally improve, extend, override,
or redefine behaviors to make them increasingly complex,
while still abstracting away messy details.

See the [TwitterShepherd](twitter_shepherd.md) page or the 
[SocialSheep](social_sheep.md) page for examples.
