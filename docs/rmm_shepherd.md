## what is the Shepherd?

The Shepherd is a very simple object. 

The Shepherd is a data container for storing Sheep.

## when does the Shepherd come in?

The first thing a bot flock needs is a set of keys.
That's what the [Keymaker](rmm_keymaker.md) is for.

Once the bot flock keys have been created with the Keymaker,
the bot flock is started. To do that, the Shepherd
initializes each Sheep with a corresponding JSON 
key file (created by the Keymaker).

## how does the Shepherd tend to the Sheep?

In general, the Shepherd is a free-range parent, and lets the 
Sheep go off and do their own thing.

Note however, that in the spirit of extensibility,
you can extend the Shepherd and Sheep classes to 
change the nature of your bot flock.
(See next section.)

## when and how do you extend the Shepherd?

The Shepherd class determines how much coordination
happens among different Sheep in the flock and between
the flock and the outside world (the Internet).

Let's look at some simple examples of when you would 
need to extend the Shepherd class, and what modifications
would be required.

### storing custom parameters

First, let's mention a feature of the Shepherd
that makes adding new parameters to extended versions
of the Shepherd class really simple.

The Shepherd constructor `__init__()` includes a 
`**kwargs` argument at the end. This will create a 
dictionary called `kwargs` with any key-value pairs 
the user passed in. This is stored in `self.params`
at the end of the constructor:

```
        self.params = kwargs
```

This means that if you create a new Shepherd class
like `CarMechanicShepherd`, and you need to pass in 
(say) a boolean input parameter like `uses_metric`, 
you don't have to explicitly modify the constructor
to take `uses_metric` as a parameter;
the Shepherd class automatically adds 
a key `uses_metric` with a value `True||False`
to a dictionary `self.params` when you
call the constructor like 

```
CarMechanicShepherd(uses_metric=False)
```

Okay, back to the regularly scheduled program...

### webhook bot flock

As an example of a bot flock that requires tighter integration
between the Shepherd and the Sheep, imagine you want to create
a bot fock where the bots can be controlled with webhooks.

You would need the Shepherd to act as a central dispatcher 
and process incoming webhooks to determine which webhook 
payloads to pass on to which Sheep. But the Sheep also need
to be modified to listen for instructions from the Shepherd.

To modify the Shepherd class, we would add a method 
that listens for incoming webhooks, and a method or 
methods implementing logic about which payloads to
pass along to which Sheep (or to call the appropriate
functions when webhooks trigger flock-wide actions).

To modify the Sheep class, we would add a `listen()` method
that would run forever - ideally in parallel with other
run-forever methods.


### two bots per key flock

Suppose we wanted to build an argument bot flock.
This bot flock would consist of pairs of Sheep
that use Queneau generation to create dialogue,
and that argue back and forth forever with each other.

This bot flock modifies the way that our Sheep
coordinate with each other, which is an indication
we should change the Shepherd class.

The Sheep bots we will use will work identically to
a normal Queneau Sheep bot. Each bot generates dialogue
from a single speaker, and tweets it in response to 
another bot tweeting.

While we can extend the Sheep class to make it easier
to set fine grained controls over the dialogue process,
we can use the existing inner-outer loop structure
of Queneau bots to accomplish our goal.

So, Sheep do not require any extending.

The Shepherd class needs to be modified by changing
the way it instantiates bots from keys. Instead of 
creating one bot per key, it should create two 
bots per keys. 

(Note that the user will need to provide relevant
details in the key or config dictionaries. For example,
name and handle of both bot sides, inner/outer loop timing,
etc.)

The `-setup_keys()` method will not change, because 
we want to maintain the consistency of one key file
corresponding to one bot corresponding to one Twitter 
account.

The `_setup_sheep()` method would be modified from 
its current arrangement (pseudocode):

```
current _setup_sheep() method:
    for json in list-of-all-json-files:
        create new sheep from json
        add new sheep to flock
```

to something more like (pseudocode):

```
new _setup_sheep() method:
    for (bot1, bot2) in list-of-all-bot-pairs:
        get key1 from keys
        create bot1 from key1

        get key2 from keys
        create bot2 from key2

        link bot1 and bot2
        add bot1 and bot2 to flock
```

In this case, we want to have two Queneau Sheep that 
work almost exactly the same as normal Queneau Sheep,
with perhaps a slight modification to make sure that
each bot generates dialogue from a single speaker 
corresponding to their party in the argument.
