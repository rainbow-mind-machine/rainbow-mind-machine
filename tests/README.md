# rainbow mind machine tests

Also see [../docs/dev-workflow.md](../docs/dev-workflow.md).

Current status of tests:

* `test_keymaker.py` - most complete. working through this led to significant expansion of keymaker docs.

* `test_shepherd.py` - was the next up. where is this at?

* `test_sheep.py` - keep it simple for now

To get some tests out the door and move on,
we will skip all the various subtypes 
of Shepherds and Sheep.
